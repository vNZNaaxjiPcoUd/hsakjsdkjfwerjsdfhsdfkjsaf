**Sharing the Road**
with Bicycles
In Florida, the bicycle is legally defined
as a vehicle and has all of the privileges,
rights, and responsibilities on public
roads (except limited access highways)
that a motor vehicle operator does.
Bicyclists may ride out of the bike lane
into the travel lane for their own safety
due to narrow roads, to avoid obstacles
or pavement hazards, or to prepare for
a lef turn. A bicyclist may use the full
lane even while traveling substantially
below the speed of trafic if the lane is
too narrow for both a car and bicycle
to share.
Unlike motorists, bicyclists may also
operate on sidewalks, but they must
yield to pedestrians on sidewalks and
in crosswalks.

**Rules for Motorists**

1. Florida law requires that you give
   bicyclists a minimum of three feet
   of clearance and use caution/slow
   speed when driving alongside or
   passing them.
2. On a two-lane road, pass a bicyclist as you would a slow-moving
   vehicle, and only when it is safe to
   do so.
3. At intersections, always assume
   that bicyclists are traveling straight
   unless they signal otherwise. Yield
   to bicycles just as you would to any
   other vehicle.
4. When crossing a bike lane to make
   a turn, yield to any bicyclist in the
   bike lane and make your turn
   behind the bicyclist.
5. Do not follow a bicyclist too closely.
6. At night, avoid using high beam
   headlights when you see a bicyclist
   approaching.
7. Before opening a car door, check
   for bicyclists who may be
   approaching from behind.
8. Avoid honking your horn and
   startling a bicyclist.

**Rules for Bicyclists**

1. Bicyclists must obey all trafic
   controls and signals.
2. If bicyclists are not traveling at the
   speed of other trafic, they must
   use the bike lane. If no bike lane is
   available, they must stay on the
   right-most side of the road.
3. Bicyclists are allowed to use the
   full lane when making a lef turn,
   passing, avoiding hazards, or
   when a lane is too narrow for
   them and a car to share it safely.
4. When operating a bicycle on a
   one-way street with two or more
   trafic lanes, bicyclists may ride
   on the lef-hand side of the road.
5. Bicyclists must use directional
   hand signals to show other
   drivers that they are about to
   turn. ([See page 41.](./handIndex.png))
6. Bicyclists must never attach
   themselves or their bike to any
   vehicle on the roadway.
7. If they are riding on a sidewalk or
   crosswalk, bicyclists have all the
   rights and duties a of a pedestrian. However, they must yield
   the right-of-way to pedestrians
   and must give an audible signal
   before passing pedestrians.
8. Between sunset and sunrise,
   bicyclists must have a white light
   visible from 500 feet on the front
   of their bicycle and a red reflector and a red light visible from
   600 feet on the rear.
9. Bicyclists must have brakes
   which can stop their bike within
   25 feet from a speed of 10 MPH.
10. All bicyclists and passengers
    under age 16 are required to
    wear helmets that meet federal
    safety standards.
11. If bicyclists are transporting
    a child under age four, or who
    weighs 40 pounds or less, they
    must use a backpack/sling, child
    seat, or trailer designed to carry
    children.
12. Bicyclists must not leave a child
    in a seat or carrier when they
    are not in immediate control of
    the bicycle.
13. If bicyclists are riding with
    others, they may not ride more
    than two side-by-side unless it
    is a path or part of a roadway
    reserved for bicycles. They must
    ride single file if they and the
    other rider are impeding trafic.
14. Bicyclists must not wear headphones/earbuds while bicycling
    on the roadway.
15. Bicyclists must not ride a bicycle
    when under the influence of
    alcohol or drugs.

**Bicyclist Safety Tips**

► No matter your age, wear a helmet.

► Keep both hands on the handlebars.

► On the roadway, check behind you before changing lanes or moving notably within the lane.

► Be seen. Wear neon or fluorescent colors when riding and wear something reflective.

► Don’t text while biking.

Right-of-way rules tell you who goes first and who must wait in diferent
conditions. The law says who must yield (give up) the right-of-way. Every
driver, motorcyclist, moped rider, pedestrian, and bicyclist must do
everything possible to avoid a crash.
