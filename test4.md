# Common Screen Resolutions in 2024 : Mobile, Desktop & Tablet

When Instagram on Android was first released in 2012, little did they anticipate that there would be issues in the user experience compared to their iOS users. Users observed and reported issues with layout and performance issues on the Android app. 

Testing your application on multiple screen resolutions across multiple devices is more critical and crucial for your products than 2012 as smartphone adoption is increasing rapidly.

### What is Screen Resolution?

Screen resolution defines the sharpness and detail of your screen. Resolution can also be understood as a collection of pixels that make an image. By designing applications to adapt to different resolutions, you can guarantee a smooth and enjoyable experience for users on all kinds of devices.

Higher resolutions provide sharper images and more detailed graphics, enhancing readability and overall aesthetics. Conversely, lower resolutions can result in blurred or pixelated visuals, making it difficult to read text and view images clearly. 

### Why Screen Resolutions Matter?

Screen resolution should matter to you while testing your web application because of the following reasons: 

- **Visual clarity**: Sharp and clear text in images, text, and other visual elements ensures higher screen resolution resulting in better user experience.
- **Seamless user experience:** As smartphone adoption increases, the types of devices and the screen sizes differ, making it essential to test across screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring your web application is accessible with screen readers, etc is more important now than ever.
- **Responsive design:** Modern web design often involves responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

### Responsive Web Design for seamless UX across Screen Resolutions

When you start designing your applications, consider the following so that your application gives a seamless UX experience for users across devices.

- **Flexible layouts:** Use fluid grids and percentage-based widths to ensure elements adjust automatically across different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries:** Apply CSS media queries to create styles for specific screen resolutions, enhancing adaptability.
- **Test across various devices:** Test across devices so that you can identify any issues during testing.
- **Mobile-first design:** Prioritize mobile design and progressively design for increasing sizes. Smaller screens have lesser screen area to play around with so this approach helps reduce issues later.
- **Viewport meta tag:** Set the viewport meta tag for proper scaling on different devices, improving readability and layout consistency.
- **Touch-friendly elements:** Ensure buttons and interactive elements are appropriately sized for touch screens, improving usability.

### 5 Best Practices for Implementing Responsive Design

If you are starting your journey of implementing responsive design, consider the following best practices before you begin:

- **Prioritize mobile-first testing:** Begin by conducting initial website testing on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Because a large number of users visit websites using mobile devices, this step ensures a seamless user experience for most visitors.
- **Define Breakpoints and Test Thoroughly:** Breakpoints refer to particular screen sizes at which the website layout adjusts. Collaborate with developers to grasp the breakpoints utilized and thoroughly test the website at each breakpoint size. This guarantees a smooth transition between layouts across various devices.
- **Try resolutions other than popular resolutions:** Avoid limiting testing to popular screen sizes. While testing at popular resolutions is crucial, utilize emulators or cloud-based testing tools to examine a broader range of resolutions, including those that are less common. This approach helps to pinpoint potential layout issues on less typical devices.
- **Utilize Responsive Design Testing Tools:** Explore cloud-based testing platforms that provide real device testing on a wide array of devices and browsers. This approach can greatly enhance your testing effectiveness and breadth.

**Free Responsive Test on Commonly Used Resolutions**

Try testing the responsiveness of your website on real devices.

### Conclusion

When it comes to testing across multiple devices, default browsers through their developer tools give access to some popular devices that you can test your web application on. But, when you are creating your application with an intent for larger distribution, testing on limited devices hampers success of your web application. 

[BrowserStack Live](https://www.browserstack.com/live "Cross browser testing on desktop & mobile") apart from giving access to 3500+ browser device combinations, also gives access to plethora of features that you can leverage.
