cloud engineer roadmap 
======================

cloud engineer roadmap can seem daunting, but it can be broken down into manageable steps.&#x20;

𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟭: 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀

Understand the basics of cloud computing: What is cloud computing? What are the different cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)? How does the cloud work?

Learn about virtualization technologies: Virtualization is the foundation of cloud computing. Get familiar with concepts like virtual machines (VMs) and hypervisors.

Choose a cloud platform to specialize in: There are many different cloud platforms out there, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Choose one to focus on and learn its core services.

Study the basics of networking: Networking is essential for cloud-based applications. Understand concepts like IP addresses, subnets, and firewalls.


𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟮: 𝗗𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲

Delve into cloud security and identity management: Cloud security is critical for protecting your data and applications. Learn about security best practices and identity management tools.

Explore containers and orchestration with Kubernetes: Containers are a popular way to package and deploy applications. Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that helps you manage containerized applications.

Practice Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform: IaC allows you to automate the provisioning and management of your cloud infrastructure.&#x20;

Learn about cloud storage solutions and databases: There are a variety of storage options available in the cloud. Understand the different types of storage and how to choose the right one for your needs.

𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟯: 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀
