# SysML

The **systems modeling language** (**SysML**)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_modeling_language#cite_note-1) is a [general-purpose modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_modeling "General-purpose modeling") language for [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "Systems engineering") applications. It supports the specification, [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis "Analysis"), [design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design "Design"), [verification and validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation "Verification and validation") of a broad range of systems and [systems-of-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_systems "System of systems").

SysML was originally developed by an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Open source") specification project, and includes an open source license for distribution and use.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_modeling_language#cite_note-2) SysML is defined as an extension of a subset of the [Unified Modeling Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language "Unified Modeling Language") (UML) using [UML's profile mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_(UML) "Profile (UML)"). The language's extensions were designed to support systems engineering activities.

## Contrast with UML[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Systems_modeling_language&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Contrast with UML")]

SysML offers several systems engineering specific improvements over [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modelling_Language "Unified Modelling Language"), which has been developed as a software modeling language. These improvements include the following:

- SysML's diagrams express system engineering concepts better due to the removal of UML's software-centric restrictions and adds two new diagram types, requirement and parametric diagrams. The former can be used for [requirements engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_engineering "Requirements engineering"); the latter can be used for [performance analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming) "Profiling (computer programming)") and [quantitative analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"). Consequent to these enhancements, SysML is able to model a wide range of systems, which may include hardware, software, information, processes, personnel, and facilities.
- SysML is a comparatively small language that is easier to learn and apply.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_modeling_language#cite_note-3) Since SysML removes many of UML's software-centric constructs, the overall language is smaller both in diagram types and total constructs.
- SysML allocation tables support common kinds of allocations. Whereas UML provides only limited support for tabular notations, SysML furnishes flexible allocation tables that support requirements allocation, functional allocation, and structural allocation. This capability facilitates automated [verification and validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation "Verification and validation") (V&V) and gap analysis.
- SysML model management constructs support models, views, and viewpoints. These constructs extend UML's capabilities and are architecturally aligned with [IEEE-Std-1471-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-Std-1471-2000 "IEEE-Std-1471-2000") (IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems).

SysML reuses seven of UML 2's fourteen diagrams, and adds two diagrams (requirement and parametric diagrams) for a total of nine diagram types. SysML also supports allocation tables, a tabular format that can be dynamically derived from SysML allocation relationships. A table which compares SysML and UML 2 diagrams is available in the SysML FAQ.

Consider modeling an automotive system: with SysML one can use Requirement diagrams to efficiently capture functional, performance, and interface requirements, whereas with UML one is subject to the limitations of [use case diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case_diagram "Use case diagram") to define high-level functional requirements. Likewise, with SysML one can use Parametric diagrams to precisely define performance and quantitative constraints like maximum [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration"), minimum [curb weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_weight "Curb weight"), and total [air conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning "Air conditioning") capacity. UML provides no straightforward mechanism to capture this sort of essential performance and quantitative information.

Concerning the rest of the automotive system, enhanced [activity diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram "Activity diagram") and [state machine diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram#UML_state_diagram "State diagram") can be used to specify the [embedded software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software "Embedded software") control logic and information flows for the on-board automotive computers. Other SysML structural and behavioral diagrams can be used to model factories that build the automobiles, as well as the interfaces between the organizations that work in the factories.
