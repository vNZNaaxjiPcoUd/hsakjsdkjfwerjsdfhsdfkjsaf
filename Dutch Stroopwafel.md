Did you ever imagine that you could make stroopwafels at home? It’s totally doable. These are really, really good stroopwafels. Almost as good as the ones I’ve had hot off the stroopwafel cart in Gouda!

In fact, my Dutch husband said my homemade stroopwafels were “perfect”. Believe me, being Dutch, he is not one for false flattery.

You do need one special piece of equipment and should seek-out one special ingredient.

You will need a waffle maker to bake the cookies. Not a waffle maker like you’d use for [](https://www.baking-sense.com/2016/03/19/whole-grain-sourdough-waffles/)breakfast waffles, but a waffle iron designed to make [](https://www.baking-sense.com/2018/07/03/ice-cream-cones/)ice cream cones or pizzelles.

The special ingredient is Dutch stroop. You can buy it on-line and you’ll find a link in the recipe card (As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases). If you can’t find stroop, see the FAQ section below for a substitution.
