##### About GreatSchools

The GreatSchools Summary Rating is based on several metrics.

**About the ratings:** GreatSchools Ratings are designed to be a starting point to help parents compare schools, and should not be the only factor used in selecting the right school for your family. Zillow and GreatSchools recommend that parents tour multiple schools in-person to inform that choice. As of October 2020, the GreatSchools Ratings methodology continues to move beyond proficiency and standardized test scores. The latest methodology prioritizes student growth through measures of equity and school quality.[Learn more](https://www.greatschools.org/gk/ratings/)

**Disclaimer:** School attendance zone boundaries are provided by a third party and are subject to change. They are not guaranteed to be accurate, up to date, or complete. Check with the applicable school district prior to making a decision based on these boundaries.
